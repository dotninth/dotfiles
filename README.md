# General Information

I'm trying to move from **"configure everything"** to **"configure as little as possible"**. That's one of the reasons I chose **Helix** over **Vim** *(or NeoVim)*, for example.

I don't use **tmux**, but I use **Ghostty**'s built-in panels and set up keybindings the way most people set up tmux.

This setup is highly opionated. That's because it's mine and it's made specifically for me.

Oh, and I dailydrive Fedora Linux...

> I do not recommend using this dotfiles as is, but use it as inspiration for your own. You can try it though.
